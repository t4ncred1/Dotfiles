# My Dotfiles
These are my configuration files for my \*nix machines.

## Management
These dotfiles are deployed on each machine with `stow`, a symlink farm manager.
I don't use all the tools I have configuration files for simultaneously (most of the times), and `stow` lets me select which configuration files to symlink in order to keep my `$HOME` tidy.
